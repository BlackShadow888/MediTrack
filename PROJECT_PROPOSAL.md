    <h2><span class="emoji">💡</span>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      From firsthand experience working in medical surveillance, managing high volumes of patient testing across multiple locations is cumbersome. Existing solutions often rely on spreadsheets and disconnected systems. <strong>MediTrack</strong> consolidates these tasks into a modern, web-based dashboard with real-time syncing, intuitive scheduling, and comprehensive reporting.

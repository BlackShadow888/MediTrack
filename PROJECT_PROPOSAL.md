# Project Proposal: MediTrack

## 🎯 Goal

To build a full-stack Patient Management Dashboard for occupational health teams to coordinate appointments, manage compliance tasks, and reduce manual administrative overhead.

## 💡 Motivation

While working in medical surveillance, I experienced first-hand the challenges of managing large volumes of patient testing across different locations. Most teams relied on spreadsheets and disconnected systems. MediTrack brings it all together into a modern web-based dashboard with real-time syncing, scheduling, and reporting.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- React + Tailwind CSS + FullCalendar.js
- Node.js + Express + MongoDB + JWT
- Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) + Render (API)
- Bonus: SharePoint/CSV-compatible output, PDF summaries, analytics

## 🗓️ Core Features

- Patient record management
- Calendar integration with drag-and-drop rescheduling
- Role-based access control (admin, tech, view-only)
- (Optional) Email/SMS reminders
- (Optional) Report exports

## ✅ Outcomes

This project will demonstrate:
- Real-world UX problem solving
- Full-stack CRUD implementation
- Complex state & calendar management
- Domain knowledge integration (healthcare systems)
- Professional code organization & deployment
